    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p><span class="text-tiny"><em>A couple sentences describing a high-level overview of what the project is or does.</em></span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Need/Use Case</h2>
    <p><span class="text-tiny"><em>Describe what the need is. &nbsp;If there was a use case that led to the idea, explain it here. &nbsp;Why would this be helpful?</em></span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Related Tools and Topics</h2>
    <p><span class="text-tiny"><em>Link any relevant tools or topics to the project here.</em></span>

    </ul>
    <h2>Minimum Demonstration Milestones</h2>
    <p><span class="text-tiny"><em>List the milestones that would need to be achieved at a minimum to demonstrate the value of the idea. &nbsp;This would be the point to evaluate if the idea is viable enough to invest more effort in.&nbsp;</em></span>

    <h2>Reach Milestones</h2>
    <p><span class="text-tiny"><em>List ideas for further feature ideas. &nbsp;These features aren’t necessarily required to get an idea if the project is viable/helpful but might be worth adding in the future if the project is continued. &nbsp;This is just to document feature ideas, so they don’t get lost.</em></span>

    <h2>Estimated Project Impact</h2>
    <p><strong>High</strong> - Would help with daily tasks, would be useful to
      many people, would automate hours worth of work, would help reduce risks
      or error, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Medium</strong> - Would automate boring tasks, used monthly, only
      applicable to a few teams, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Low</strong> - Fixes minor inconveniences, personal projects not
      applicable to many others, not really necessary to complete day to day
      work, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Other</strong> - Well...it's more about the journey than the destination.
      (Probably not useful but it might be fun!)</p>
