## Minimum Demonstration Milestones

<!-- List the milestones that would need to be achieved at a minimum to demonstrate the value of the idea.  This would be the point to evaluate if the idea is viable enough to invest more effort in. -->
<!-- //TODO Add Milestones -->

1. 

## Reach Milestones

<!-- List ideas for further feature ideas.  These features aren’t necessarily required to get an idea if the project is viable/helpful but might be worth adding in the future if the project is continued.  This is just to document feature ideas, so they don’t get lost. -->

## Estimated Project Impact

<!-- //TODO Choose Estimated Impact (Delete the rest) -->

**High** - Would help with daily tasks, would be useful to many people, would automate hours worth of work, would help reduce risks or error, etc.

**Medium** - Would automate boring tasks, used monthly, only applicable to a few teams, etc.

**Low** - Fixes minor inconvieneces, personal projects not applicable to many others, not really neccesary to complete day to day work, etc.

**Other** - Well...it's more about the journey than the destination.  (Probably not useful but it might be fun!)
